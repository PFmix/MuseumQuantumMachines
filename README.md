# MuseumQuantumMachines
Here are the codes and extra materials to build simple devices simulating Quantum concepts for museum displays.

# Description of the repositories
The repository contain the code for Arduino and some extra material to build various devices simulating Quantum concepts for museum exhibit.
They have been realized within the Outreach activities of the NCCR Spin project.

There are three projects corresponding to three devices in total:
-an interactive display "board" presenting the most basic concept of qubit, quantum superposition, and quantum entanglement;
-an interactive "quantum rock-paper-scissor device" building up on these notions in a (simple) game context;
-an interactive "quantum teleporter" simulating the protocol of a single Qubit teleportation.

# Collaborators and affiliations
The idea, global design, code writing and testing, and part of the assembling was realised by Pierre Fromholz.
Part of the assembling and the wiring blueprints were realized by the workshop of the University of Basel, most notably Andreas Tonin.
Part of the dressing of the devices were realized by Marie Le Dantec.
All three parties belong to the University of Basel.
