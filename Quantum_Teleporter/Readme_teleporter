#Description

The device mimics the standard protocol for the Quantum teleportation of a single Qubit. The initial Bell state is |01>+|10> for presentation reasons. In this representation, the X gate is a rotation of 180°, while the Z gate is the inversion of the angle.

#Bug
-For some reason, rarely, the Z gate will acts as an X gate.

#Electronic components:
-1 Arduino Uno R4 Minima
-1 EC11 Rotary Encoder
-3 Parallax Feedback 360° High Speed servo
-various leds, resistors, and push buttons
